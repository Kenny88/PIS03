     The files in this directory are encoded in ISO 646-IRV encoding as a lowest
common denominator for initial development purposes.

     NOTE The default encoding for these files should be Unicode.  As a
          temporary measure this has not yet been done.

     Where a new environment requires some other encoding then the auxiliary
program ccm should be used to effect the code translation.  Should the
environment involve a non-English culture then a language expert should be
invited to make correct translations of all of the message text, paying
particular attention to the notes which accompany the cultedit auxiliary
program.
